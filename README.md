# JFCN
In 2006 friends planned Chigbo Anichebe’s wedding, grew closer and expanded. In 2013, led by Fred Ohwahwa, a five-member committee drafted a constitution; the group became the Just Friends Club of Nigeria (JFCN) and was registered August 30, 2013 as a non-profit promoting members’ welfare, unity and philanthropy.
